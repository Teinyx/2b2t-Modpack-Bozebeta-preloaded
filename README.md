# 2b2t Modpack Info
### Modpack Intro
Welcome to the first ever 2b2t curated modpack for **MultiMc**.
This pack was origionaly created for private use for me and my 2b2t 
group but later on was developed for the public and anyone who wishes to
use it!

The pack is filled with almost every mod a 2b2t player could need/use. i tried my best to create a modpack
without extensive bloat mods and a pack with decent optimization.
